# üîß **OUTLOOK EMAIL AUTHENTICATION FIX GUIDE**

## ‚ùå **Current Issue**
Your Outlook account has "basic authentication disabled" which prevents SMTP access.

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Enable SMTP AUTH in Outlook (Recommended)**

1. **Sign in to your Microsoft Account:**
   - Go to: https://account.microsoft.com/security
   - Sign in with: `ClickSafe_Srilanka@outlook.com`

2. **Enable SMTP Authentication:**
   - Go to **Security** ‚Üí **Advanced security options**
   - Look for **"Authenticated SMTP"** or **"SMTP AUTH"**
   - **Turn ON** SMTP authentication
   - Save settings

3. **Alternative: Office 365 Admin Center (if business account):**
   - Go to: https://admin.microsoft.com
   - Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Mail flow** ‚Üí **Authenticated SMTP**
   - **Enable** SMTP AUTH for your account

### **Option 2: Use Gmail as Email Provider (Easier)**

If Outlook continues to have issues, we can switch to Gmail:

1. **Create Gmail account** (or use existing)
2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication**
3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and generate password
4. **Update the configuration** (I can help with this)

### **Option 3: Use Microsoft Graph API (Most Secure)**

For production systems, Microsoft recommends OAuth2:
- More complex setup but most secure
- No password storage needed
- Better for enterprise applications
