## Why These Files Were Moved

- **Clean Production Environment**: Main directory contains only essential files
- **Development History**: Preserve development utilities and test scripts
- **Reference**: Keep diagnostic and debugging tools for troubleshooting
- **Backup Safety**: Maintain backup versions of critical services

## Usage Notes

- These files can be moved back to main directory if needed for development
- Some utilities may require database access or specific environment setup
- Test files may need updating if database schema changes
- HTML files can be opened directly in browsers for diagnostic interfaces

## Restoration

To restore any file to the main directory:
```bash
# Example: Restore a utility file
cp backup/cleanup_duplicates.py ../

# Example: Restore diagnostic tools
cp backup/*diagnostic* ../
```
